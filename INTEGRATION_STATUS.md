# GentleCare - Production Handoff

## Release Parts

### Part 1: Backend stability and secret cleanup
- Moved sensitive configuration to environment variables in the production backend path.
- Removed the hardcoded Gemini key from the legacy backend entrypoint.
- Added capability and health endpoints so deployment can report AI readiness instead of failing silently.

### Part 2: Real-time multi-user sync
- Added elder/caretaker resolution on the server so caretaker actions resolve to the correct elder profile.
- Broadcast care-team updates for medications, health records, meals, appointments, emergency contacts, and prescriptions.
- Added the missing meal creation endpoint used by the client.

### Part 3: Client hydration and live updates
- Reconnected the socket automatically on app launch for persisted sessions.
- Added realtime refresh listeners to elder and caretaker screens.
- Replaced empty sample-data fallbacks with truthful empty states and clearer guidance.

### Part 4: Deployment readiness
- Added Render blueprint config for the API and Expo web build.
- Switched the API runtime to a compatible Gunicorn threaded startup.
- Verified Expo web export, backend syntax, lint, and local startup on the production command.

## Current Status

The app is now code-complete for deployment, but the live production health still depends on Render environment variables being set correctly.

Required external values on Render:
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` for the web service

When those values are present, the backend reports AI readiness through `/health` and `/capabilities`, and the web export plus API startup path are already validated locally.

# GentleCare - Backend Integration Complete! 🎉

## What's Been Done

### ✅ Backend Server (Comprehensive)
**Location**: `/Server/app_new.py`
**Status**: Running on `http://10.11.150.250:5001`

**Features Implemented:**
1. **Authentication System**
   - JWT-based secure authentication
   - Separate Elder & Caretaker account types
   - Link Elder to Caretaker functionality
   - Persistent sessions

2. **Real-time Synchronization**
   - WebSocket (Socket.IO) integration
   - Instant updates between Elder and Caretaker
   - When elder takes action → Caretaker sees it immediately

3. **Medication Management**
   - Add/view medications with full details
   - Log medication taken/skipped/missed
   - **Real-time notification** to caretaker when elder logs medication
   - Medication history tracking

4. **Health Records**
   - Track vitals: blood pressure, heart rate, weight, temperature, etc.
   - Historical data with date filtering
   - **Real-time sync** to caretaker dashboard

5. **Meal Tracking**
   - Add meals with nutrition info (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
   - Mark meals as consumed
   - **Real-time notification** to caretaker

6. **Appointments**
   - Schedule medical appointments
   - Track doctor info, location, notes
   - Status management (scheduled/completed/cancelled)
   - **Real-time sync** between elder and caretaker

7. **Location Tracking**
   - Update elder location in real-time
   - Track accuracy and timestamp
   - **Live location updates** on caretaker's map

8. **Emergency Contacts**
   - Store multiple contacts with relationship
   - Primary contact designation
   - Phone, email, relationship info

9. **Push Notifications**
   - In-app notification system
   - Mark as read functionality
   - Notification types: medication, appointment, health, emergency

10. **AI Chatbot** (Existing - maintained)
    - Voice transcription (Speech-to-Text)
    - AI conversation (Gemini)
    - Text-to-Speech responses

### ✅ Frontend Integration Started
**Location**: `/Client/services/api.ts`

**API Service Created** with all methods:
- `authAPI` - Login, signup, link caretaker, logout
- `medicationAPI` - Get, add, log medications
- `healthAPI` - Get records, add health data
- `mealAPI` - Get, add, consume meals
- `appointmentAPI` - Get, add, update appointments
- `notificationAPI` - Get all, mark as read
- `locationAPI` - Update, get location
- `emergencyContactAPI` - Get, add, delete contacts
- `chatbotAPI` - Transcribe, chat, speak
- `socketService` - Real-time WebSocket connection

**Screens Updated:**
1. ✅ **Elder Medications** (`/Client/app/elder/Medications.tsx`)
   - Loads medications from backend
   - Logs when medication is taken
   - **Real-time notification to caretaker**
   - Add new medications with modal
   - Shows last taken time
   - Loading states

2. ✅ **Elder Login** (`/Client/app/auth/elderLogin.tsx`)
   - Authenticates with backend
   - Stores JWT token
   - Validates user type (elder)
   - Error handling
   - Loading state

### 🔄 Real-Time Sync Examples

**When Elder Takes Action:**
```
Elder marks medication as taken
    ↓
Backend logs it
    ↓
WebSocket emits event
    ↓
Caretaker's dashboard updates instantly
    ↓
Caretaker sees: "✅ John took Aspirin at 8:30 AM"
```

**Same for:**
- Meal consumed
- Health vitals recorded
- Location updated
- Appointment scheduled

## How It Works

### Authentication Flow:
```
1. User logs in → JWT token stored locally
2. Token automatically sent with all API requests
3. WebSocket connects with user ID
4. User joins their real-time room
5. Events broadcast to relevant users
```

### Elder-Caretaker Link:
```
1. Elder signs up
2. Elder enters caretaker's email
3. Backend links them
4. Caretaker sees elder in their list
5. All elder actions now sync to caretaker
```

## How to Test

### 1. Backend is Running:
```bash
# Check terminal - should show:
* Running on http://10.11.150.250:5001
```

### 2. Test in App:
1. Open app in iOS Simulator or phone
2. Navigate to Elder Login
3. Try logging in (will fail - no users yet)
4. Need to add signup functionality OR create test user directly

### 3. Create Test User Manually:
```python
# Option 1: Use Python shell
cd Server
python
>>> from app_new import app, db, User, ElderProfile
>>> from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
>>> bcrypt = Bcrypt()
>>> with app.app_context():
...     user = User(
...         email='elder@test.com',
...         password_hash=bcrypt.generate_password_hash('password').decode('utf-8'),
...         full_name='Test Elder',
...         user_type='elder'
...     )
...     db.session.add(user)
...     db.session.flush()
...     profile = ElderProfile(user_id=user.id)
...     db.session.add(profile)
...     db.session.commit()
```

### 4. Test Login:
- Email: `elder@test.com`
- Password: `password`

### 5. Test Medication:
1. Login as elder
2. Go to Medications screen
